# Character-Seperation-in-Bengali

A program in C which takes a black and white binary text image in bengali language as input ans outputs it with all of its characters seperated
Colour values and some font sizes are hard-codes so for it to work efficiently those values have to be tweaked in files to ensure efficient execution.
